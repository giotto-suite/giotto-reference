# `createGiottoXeniumObject` {#createGiottoXeniumObject}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* Create 10x Xenium Giotto Object

## Description

Create a Giotto object from a Xenium experiment output folder.
Only the `xenium_dir`, `load_images`, and `load_aligned_images` params
need to be supplied when defaults are sufficient. All other params have
defaults set and are there in case of non-standard directory layouts or
alternative preference in file format to load from.  

When possible, `.parquet` files are loaded. This requires the additional
installation of **arrow** with zstd support. See details. `h5` is also
used by default if the 10x provided expression matrix is loaded.  

The 10X provided aggregated expression matrix and cell metdata are not
loaded by default since the results may be slightly different from those
that Giotto spatially aggregates.

## Usage

```r
createGiottoXeniumObject(
  xenium_dir,
  transcript_path = NULL,
  bounds_path = list(cell = "cell", nucleus = "nucleus"),
  gene_panel_json_path = NULL,
  expression_path = NULL,
  cell_metadata_path = NULL,
  feat_type = c("rna", "NegControlProbe", "UnassignedCodeword", "NegControlCodeword",
    "GenomicControl"),
  split_keyword = list("NegControlProbe", "UnassignedCodeword", "NegControlCodeword",
    "GenomicControl"),
  qv_threshold = 20,
  load_images = "focus",
  load_aligned_images = NULL,
  load_transcripts = TRUE,
  load_expression = TRUE,
  load_cellmeta = FALSE,
  instructions = NULL,
  verbose = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `xenium_dir`: Full path to the exported xenium directory
- `transcript_path`: Optional. Filepath to desired transcripts file to
load. Either the `.parquet` or `.csv` files can be used.
- `bounds_path`: Optional. Named list of filepaths to desired Xenium
bounds/polygon files to load. Either the `.parquet` or `.csv` files can be
used. The default is to load the `.parquets` of both cell and nucleus.
- `gene_panel_json_path`: Optional. Filepath to panel json. This json
contains feature metadata information and ENSG names.
- `expression_path`: Optional. Filepath to cell feature matrix. Accepts
either the `.h5` or the unzipped directory containing `.mtx` files.
- `cell_metadata_path`: Optional. Filepath to `cells.csv.gz` or
`cells.parquet`
which contain cell metadata information.
- `feat_type`: character. feature type. Provide more than one value if
using the `split_keyword` param. For each set of keywords to split by, an
additional feat_type should be provided in the same order. Affects how
the transcripts information is loaded. Helpful for separating out the
QC probes. See details.
- `split_keyword`: list of character vectors of keywords to split the
transcripts based on their feat_ID. Keywords will be `grepl()`
matched against the feature IDs information. See details.
- `qv_threshold`: Minimum Phred-scaled quality score cutoff to be included
as a subcellular transcript detection (default = 20)
- `load_images`: Named list of filepaths to `.tif` images, usually the
ones in the `morphology_focus` directory. These `ome.tif` images are not
compatible and must be converted to `tif` using
[GiottoClass::to_simple_tif()].
- `load_aligned_images`: Named list of filepaths. The list names are used
as the image names when loaded. Two filepaths are expected per entry. The
first one should be to the `.tif` image. The second path is to the `.csv`
alignment matrix file. `ome.tif` images will work, but they are currently
slower in our imaging pipeline.
- `load_expression`: logical. Default = FALSE. Whether to load in 10X
provided expression matrix.
- `load_cellmeta`: logical. Default = FALSE. Whether to load in 10X
provided cell metadata information
- `instructions`: list of instructions or output result from
`[createGiottoInstructions()](=createGiottoInstructions)`
- `verbose`: logical or NULL. NULL uses the `giotto.verbose` option
setting and defaults to TRUE.

## Value

`giotto` object

## Details

[**arrow zstd support**]
Xenium parquets have zstd compression. **arrow** is used to access
parquets, however it may not install on all systems with zstd by default.
You can check whether zstd support is installed by running:
`arrow::arrow_info()$capabilities[["zstd"]]`. If `FALSE`, it needs to be
reinstalled with the following:

```

 Sys.setenv(ARROW_WITH_ZSTD = "ON")
 install.packages("arrow", repos = c("https://apache.r-universe.dev"))

```


[**QC feature types**]
Xenium provides info on feature detections that include more than only the
Gene Expression specific probes. Additional probes for QC are included:
*blank codeword*, *negative control codeword*, and
*negative control probe*. These additional QC probes each occupy and
are treated as their own feature types so that they can largely remain
independent of the gene expression information.

[**feat_type and split_keyword**]
Additional QC probe information is in the subcellular feature detections
information and must be separated from the gene expression information
during processing.
The QC probes have prefixes that allow them to be selected from the rest of
the feature IDs.
Giotto uses `feat_type` and `split_keyword` params to select these QC
probes out as separate feature types. See examples in
[GiottoClass::createGiottoPoints] for how this works.

The Gene expression subset labeled as `rna` is accepted as the subset of
feat_IDs that do not get matched to any of the `split_keywords`.
