# `sampling_sp_genes` {#sampling_sp_genes}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* sampling_sp_genes

## Description

function to select a set of spatial genes

## Usage

```r
sampling_sp_genes(clust, sample_rate = 2, target = 500, seed = 10)
```

## Arguments

- `clust`: spatial gene clusters
- `sample_rate`: sampling rate, takes values equal or greater than 1
- `target`: target length of gene list
- `seed`: random seed

## Value

list

## Details

This function samples a subset of spatial genes among different clusters,
with size n = target.
Number of samples from each cluster denpends on the relative proportion of
each cluster.
Changing from equal size by setting sample_rate = 1 to with exact proportion
of each cluster by setting sample_rate = +Inf
