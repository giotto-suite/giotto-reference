# `do_spatial_knn_smoothing` {#do_spatial_knn_smoothing}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* do_spatial_knn_smoothing

## Description

smooth gene expression over a kNN spatial network

## Usage

```r
do_spatial_knn_smoothing(
  expression_matrix,
  spatial_network,
  subset_feats = NULL,
  b = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `expression_matrix`: gene expression values to use
- `spatial_network`: spatial network to use
- `subset_feats`: subset of features to use
- `b`: smoothing factor beteen 0 and 1 (default: automatic)

## Value

matrix with smoothened gene expression values based on kNN
spatial network

## Details

This function will smoothen the gene expression values per cell
according to its neighbors in the selected spatial network.   

b is a smoothening factor that defaults to 1 - 1/k, where k is the median
number of k-neighbors in the selected spatial network. Setting b = 0 means
no smoothing and b = 1 means no contribution from its own expression.
