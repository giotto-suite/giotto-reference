# `reduceDims` {#reduceDims}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* Run dimension reduction method

## Description

Wrapper function for Giotto dimension reduction methods for easier coding.

## Usage

```r
reduceDims(
  gobject,
  method = c("pca", "nmf", "umap", "tsne"),
  projection = FALSE,
  toplevel = 1L,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `method`: character. Dimension reduction method to use
- `projection`: logical. Whether to run in a projection manner
(faster, but is an approximation)
- `toplevel`: relative stackframe the call was made at. do not use.
- `...`: additional params to pass to specific functions

## Value

`giotto` object with attached dimension reduction

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("vis")
x <- reduceDims(g, "tsne", spat_unit = "cell")
x <- reduceDims(x, "umap", projection = TRUE)
x <- reduceDims(x, method = "nmf")
```
