## Value

`giotto` object

## Details

Currently there are two 'methods' to normalize your raw counts data.

A. The standard method follows the standard protocol which can be adjusted
using the provided parameters and follows the following order:   

- 1. Data normalization for total library size and scaling by a custom
scale-factor.
- 2. Log transformation of data.
- 3. Z-scoring of data by genes and/or cells.

B. The normalization method as provided by the osmFISH paper is also
implemented:   

- 1. First normalize genes, for each gene divide the counts by the
total gene count and multiply by the total number of genes.
- 2. Next normalize cells, for each cell divide the normalized gene
counts by the total counts per cell and multiply by the total number of
cells.

C. The normalization method as provided by Lause/Kobak et al is also
implemented:   

- 1. First calculate expected values based on Pearson correlations.
- 2. Next calculate z-scores based on observed and expected values.

D. Quantile normalization across features
- 1. Rank feature expression
- 2. Define a common distribution by sorting expression values per
feature then finding the mean across all features per index
- 3. Apply common distribution to expression information by using
the ranks from step 1 as indices

By default the latter two results will be saved in the Giotto slot for
scaled expression, this can be changed by changing the update_slot parameters

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")

normalizeGiotto(g) # default is method A
```
