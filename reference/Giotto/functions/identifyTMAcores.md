*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* Split cluster annotations based on a spatial network

## Description

Split cluster annotations based on a spatial network

## Usage

```r
identifyTMAcores(
  gobject,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  spatial_network_name = "Delaunay_network",
  core_id_name = "core_id",
  id_fmt = "%d",
  include_all_ids = TRUE,
  missing_id_name = "not_connected",
  min_nodes = 5,
  join_split_cores = TRUE,
  join_tolerance = 1.2,
  return_gobject = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `spat_unit`: spatial unit (e.g. "cell")
- `feat_type`: feature type (e.g. "rna", "dna", "protein")
- `spatial_network_name`: character. Name of spatial network to use
- `core_id_name`: metadata column name for the core information
- `id_fmt`: character. [sprintf] formatting to use for core ids
- `include_all_ids`: logical. Include all ids, including vertex ids not
found in the spatial network
- `missing_id_name`: character. Name for nodes that are not connected to
a core.
- `min_nodes`: numeric. Minimal number of nodes to not be considered
an unconnected group.
- `join_split_cores`: logical. Attempt to repair core IDs when a core
is split down the middle and detected as two different cores.
- `join_tolerance`: numeric. Max ratio allowed relative to previous max
core convex hull area when determining if a pair of cores should be joined.
- `return_gobject`: logical. Return giotto object

## Value

cluster annotations
