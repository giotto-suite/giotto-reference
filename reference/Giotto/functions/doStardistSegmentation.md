# `doStardistSegmentation` {#doStardistSegmentation}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* perform Stardist segmentation

## Description

Perform the Giotto wrapper of Stardist 2D segmentation. This is for a model
inference to generate segmentation mask file from input image.
main parameters needed

## Usage

```r
doStardistSegmentation(
  input,
  mask_output,
  python_env = "giotto_segmentation",
  model_name = "2D_versatile_fluo",
  nuclei_channel = NULL,
  prob_thresh = NULL,
  nms_thresh = NULL,
  verbose = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `input`: character, required. Provide a path to an image.
- `mask_output`: required. Provide a path to the output mask file.
- `python_env`: python environment with Stardist installed.
default = "giotto_segmentation". See Stardist official website for more 
details.
- `model_name`: Name of the model to run inference. Default to 
'2D_versatile_fluo'. If using HE model, input image must be RGB, else the 
nuclei_channel must be given
- `nuclei_channel`: Required using IF based nuclei segmentation, channel 
number of the nuclei staining.
- `prob_thresh`: prob_thresh for model (if not given use model default)
- `nms_thresh`: nms_thresh for model (if not given use model default)

## Value

No return variable, as this will write directly to output path 
provided.

## Examples

```r
doStardistSegmentation(
    input = input_image,
    mask_output = output,
    model_name = "2D_versatile_fluo",
    nuclei_channel = 3
)
```
