# `detectSpatialCorFeats` {#detectSpatialCorFeats}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* Detect spatially correlated features
*Aliases:* `detectSpatialCorFeatsMatrix`

## Description

Detect features that are spatially correlated. Functions for
starting from either a gobject (`detectSpatialCorFeats()`) or individual
pieces of data (`detectSpatialCorFeatsMatrix()`) are provided.

## Usage

```r
detectSpatialCorFeats(
  gobject,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  spat_loc_name = "raw",
  method = c("grid", "network"),
  expression_values = c("normalized", "scaled", "custom"),
  subset_feats = NULL,
  spatial_network_name = "Delaunay_network",
  network_smoothing = NULL,
  spatial_grid_name = "spatial_grid",
  min_cells_per_grid = 4,
  cor_method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman")
)

detectSpatialCorFeatsMatrix(
  expression_matrix,
  method = c("grid", "network"),
  spatial_network,
  spatial_grid,
  spatial_locs,
  subset_feats = NULL,
  network_smoothing = NULL,
  min_cells_per_grid = 4,
  cor_method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman")
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `spat_unit`: spatial unit
- `feat_type`: feature type
- `spat_loc_name`: name for spatial locations
- `method`: method to use for spatial averaging
- `expression_values`: gene expression values to use
- `subset_feats`: subset of features to use
- `spatial_network_name`: name of spatial network to use
- `network_smoothing`: smoothing factor between 0 and 1
(has automatic default, see details)
- `spatial_grid_name`: name of spatial grid to use
- `min_cells_per_grid`: minimum number of cells to consider a grid
- `cor_method`: correlation method
- `expression_matrix`: provided expression matrix
- `spatial_network`: provided spatial network
- `spatial_grid`: provided spatial grid
- `spatial_locs`: provided spatial locations

## Value

returns a spatial correlation object: `spatCorObject`

## Details

For `method = network`, it expects a fully connected spatial network.
You can make sure to create a
fully connected network by setting minimal_k > 0 in the
`[createSpatialNetwork]` function.
1. **grid-averaging:** average gene expression values within a predefined
spatial grid
1. **network-averaging:** smoothens the gene expression matrix by
averaging the expression within one cell by using the neighbours within
the predefined spatial network. `b` is a smoothening factor passed by
`network_smoothing` param that defaults to `1 - 1/k`, where `k`
is the median number of k-neighbors in the selected spatial network.
Setting `b = 0` means no smoothing and `b = 1` means no
contribution from its own expression.


The `spatCorObject` can be further explored with `showSpatialCorFeats()`

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")

# Perform with data in a gobject
detectSpatialCorFeats(g, method = "network")

# This analysis can also be performed with data outside of the gobject
detectSpatialCorFeatsMatrix(
    expression_matrix = getExpression(
        g,
        output = "matrix"
    ),
    method = "network",
    spatial_network = getSpatialNetwork(g, output = "networkDT")
)
```
