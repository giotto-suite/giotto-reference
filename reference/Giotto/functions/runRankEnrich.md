# `runRankEnrich` {#runRankEnrich}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* runRankEnrich

## Description

Function to calculate gene signature enrichment scores per
spatial position using a rank based approach.

## Usage

```r
runRankEnrich(
  gobject,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  sign_matrix,
  expression_values = c("normalized", "raw", "scaled", "custom"),
  reverse_log_scale = TRUE,
  logbase = 2,
  output_enrichment = c("original", "zscore"),
  ties_method = c("average", "max"),
  p_value = FALSE,
  n_times = 1000,
  rbp_p = 0.99,
  num_agg = 100,
  name = NULL,
  return_gobject = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: Giotto object
- `spat_unit`: spatial unit
- `feat_type`: feature type
- `sign_matrix`: Matrix of signature genes for each cell type / process
- `expression_values`: expression values to use
- `reverse_log_scale`: reverse expression values from log scale
- `logbase`: log base to use if reverse_log_scale = TRUE
- `output_enrichment`: how to return enrichment output
- `ties_method`: how to handle rank ties
- `p_value`: calculate p-values (boolean, default = FALSE)
- `n_times`: number of permutations to calculate for p_value
- `rbp_p`: fractional binarization threshold (default = 0.99)
- `num_agg`: number of top genes to aggregate (default = 100)
- `name`: to give to spatial enrichment results, default = rank
- `return_gobject`: return giotto object

## Value

data.table with enrichment results

## Details

sign_matrix: a rank-fold matrix with genes as row names and cell-types as
column names.
Alternatively a scRNA-seq matrix and vector with clusters can be provided
to makeSignMatrixRank, which will create the matrix for you.   


First a new rank is calculated as R = (R1*R2)^(1/2), where R1 is the rank of
fold-change for each gene in each spot and R2 is the rank of each marker in
each cell type.
The Rank-Biased Precision is then calculated as:
RBP = (1 - 0.99) * (0.99)^(R - 1)
and the final enrichment score is then calculated as the sum of top 100 RBPs.

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")
x <- findMarkers_one_vs_all(g,
    cluster_column = "leiden_clus", min_feats = 20
)
sign_gene <- x$feats

sign_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(length(sign_gene) * 8, mean = 10),
    nrow = length(sign_gene)
)
rownames(sign_matrix) <- sign_gene
colnames(sign_matrix) <- paste0("celltype_", unique(x$cluster))

runRankEnrich(
    gobject = g, sign_matrix = sign_matrix,
    expression_values = "normalized"
)
```
