# `getBalancedSpatCoexpressionFeats` {#getBalancedSpatCoexpressionFeats}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* Get balanced spatial coexpression features

## Description

Extract features from spatial co-expression modules in a
balanced manner

## Usage

```r
getBalancedSpatCoexpressionFeats(
  spatCorObject,
  maximum = 50,
  rank = c("weighted", "random", "informed"),
  informed_ranking = NULL,
  seed = NA,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- `spatCorObject`: spatial correlation object
- `maximum`: maximum number of genes to get from each spatial
co-expression module
- `rank`: ranking method (see details)
- `informed_ranking`: vector of ranked features
- `seed`: seed
- `verbose`: verbosity

## Value

balanced vector with features for each co-expression module

## Details

There are 3 different ways of selecting features from the spatial
co-expression modules
1. **weighted:** Features are ranked based on summarized pairwise
co-expression scores
1. **random:** A random selection of features, set seed for
reproducibility
1. **informed:** Features are selected based on prior information/ranking
