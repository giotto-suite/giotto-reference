# `read10xAffineImage` {#read10xAffineImage}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* read10xAffineImage

## Description

Read a 10x image that is provided with an affine matrix
transform. Loads the image in with an orientation that matches the dataset
points and polygons vector information

## Usage

```r
read10xAffineImage(
  file,
  imagealignment_path,
  name = "aligned_image",
  micron = 0.2125,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `file`: filepath to image
- `imagealignment_path`: filepath to alignment file which contains
an affine transformation matrix. Usually a `.csv` file
- `name`: character. Name to assign the image. Default is 'image'.
- `micron`: micron scaling. Directly used if a numeric is supplied.
Also prefers a filepath to the `experiment.xenium` file which contains this
info. A default of 0.2125 is provided.
