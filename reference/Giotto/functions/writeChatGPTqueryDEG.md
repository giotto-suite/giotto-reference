*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* writeChatGPTqueryDEG

## Description

This function writes a query as a .txt file that can be used
with ChatGPT or a similar LLM service to find the most likely cell types
based on the top differential expressed genes (DEGs) between identified
clusters.

## Usage

```r
writeChatGPTqueryDEG(
  DEG_output,
  top_n_genes = 10,
  tissue_type = "human breast cancer",
  folder_name = getwd(),
  file_name = "chatgpt_query.txt"
)
```

## Arguments

- `DEG_output`: the output format from the differential expression
functions
- `top_n_genes`: number of genes for each cluster
- `tissue_type`: tissue type
- `folder_name`: path to the folder where you want to save the .txt file
- `file_name`: name of .txt file

## Value

writes a .txt file to the desired location

## Details

This function does not run any LLM service. It simply creates the
.txt file that can then be used any LLM service (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, ...)
