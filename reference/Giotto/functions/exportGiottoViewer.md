# `exportGiottoViewer` {#exportGiottoViewer}

*Package:* `Giotto`  
*Title:* exportGiottoViewer

## Description

compute highly variable genes

## Usage

```r
exportGiottoViewer(
  gobject,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  spat_loc_name = "raw",
  output_directory = NULL,
  spat_enr_names = NULL,
  factor_annotations = NULL,
  numeric_annotations = NULL,
  dim_reductions,
  dim_reduction_names,
  expression_values = c("scaled", "normalized", "custom"),
  dim_red_rounding = NULL,
  dim_red_rescale = c(-20, 20),
  expression_rounding = 2,
  overwrite_dir = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `spat_unit`: spatial unit
- `feat_type`: feature types
- `spat_loc_name`: name of spatial locations to export
- `output_directory`: directory where to save the files
- `spat_enr_names`: spatial enrichment results to include for annotations
- `factor_annotations`: giotto cell annotations to view as factor
- `numeric_annotations`: giotto cell annotations to view as numeric
- `dim_reductions`: high level dimension reductions to view
- `dim_reduction_names`: specific dimension reduction names
- `expression_values`: expression values to use in Viewer
- `dim_red_rounding`: numerical indicating how to round the coordinates
- `dim_red_rescale`: numericals to rescale the coordinates
- `expression_rounding`: numerical indicating how to round the expression
data
- `overwrite_dir`: overwrite files in the directory if it already existed
- `verbose`: be verbose

## Value

writes the necessary output to use in Giotto Viewer

## Details

Giotto Viewer expects the results from Giotto Analyzer in a
specific format, which is provided by this function. To include enrichment
results from `[createSpatialEnrich]` include the provided
spatial enrichment name (default PAGE or rank) and add the gene signature
names (.e.g cell types) to the numeric annotations parameter.
