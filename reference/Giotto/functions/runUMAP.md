  - **`metric`**: Type of distance metric to use to find nearest neighbors. For
 `nn_method = "annoy"` this can be one of:

   `"euclidean"` (the default)
   `"cosine"`
   `"manhattan"`
   `"hamming"`
   `"correlation"` (a distance based on the Pearson correlation)
   `"categorical"` (see below)

For `nn_method = "hnsw"` this can be one of:

   `"euclidean"`
   `"cosine"`
   `"correlation"`

If [rnndescent](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnndescent) is
installed and `nn_method = "nndescent"` is specified then many more
metrics are avaiable, including:

 `"braycurtis"`
 `"canberra"`
 `"chebyshev"`
 `"dice"`
 `"hamming"`
 `"hellinger"`
 `"jaccard"`
 `"jensenshannon"`
 `"kulsinski"`
 `"rogerstanimoto"`
 `"russellrao"`
 `"sokalmichener"`
 `"sokalsneath"`
 `"spearmanr"`
 `"symmetrickl"`
 `"tsss"`
 `"yule"`

For more details see the package documentation of `rnndescent`.
For `nn_method = "fnn"`, the distance metric is always "euclidean".

If `X` is a data frame or matrix, then multiple metrics can be
specified, by passing a list to this argument, where the name of each item in
the list is one of the metric names above. The value of each list item should
be a vector giving the names or integer ids of the columns to be included in
a calculation, e.g. `metric = list(euclidean = 1:4, manhattan = 5:10)`.

Each metric calculation results in a separate fuzzy simplicial set, which are
intersected together to produce the final set. Metric names can be repeated.
Because non-numeric columns are removed from the data frame, it is safer to
use column names than integer ids.

Factor columns can also be used by specifying the metric name
`"categorical"`. Factor columns are treated different from numeric
columns and although multiple factor columns can be specified in a vector,
each factor column specified is processed individually. If you specify
a non-factor column, it will be coerced to a factor.

For a given data block, you may override the `pca` and `pca_center`
arguments for that block, by providing a list with one unnamed item
containing the column names or ids, and then any of the `pca` or
`pca_center` overrides as named items, e.g. `metric =
list(euclidean = 1:4, manhattan = list(5:10, pca_center = FALSE))`. This
exists to allow mixed binary and real-valued data to be included and to have
PCA applied to both, but with centering applied only to the real-valued data
(it is typical not to apply centering to binary data before PCA is applied).
- **`learning_rate`**: Initial learning rate used in optimization of the
coordinates.
- **`init`**: Type of initialization for the coordinates. Options are:
 
    `"spectral"` Spectral embedding using the normalized Laplacian
   of the fuzzy 1-skeleton, with Gaussian noise added.
    `"normlaplacian"`. Spectral embedding using the normalized
   Laplacian of the fuzzy 1-skeleton, without noise.
    `"random"`. Coordinates assigned using a uniform random
   distribution between -10 and 10.
    `"lvrandom"`. Coordinates assigned using a Gaussian
   distribution with standard deviation 1e-4, as used in LargeVis
   (Tang et al., 2016) and t-SNE.
    `"laplacian"`. Spectral embedding using the Laplacian Eigenmap
   (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002).
    `"pca"`. The first two principal components from PCA of
   `X` if `X` is a data frame, and from a 2-dimensional classical
   MDS if `X` is of class `"dist"`.
    `"spca"`. Like `"pca"`, but each dimension is then scaled
   so the standard deviation is 1e-4, to give a distribution similar to that
   used in t-SNE. This is an alias for `init = "pca", init_sdev =
   1e-4`.
    `"agspectral"` An "approximate global" modification of
   `"spectral"` which all edges in the graph to a value of 1, and then
   sets a random number of edges (`negative_sample_rate` edges per
   vertex) to 0.1, to approximate the effect of non-local affinities.
    A matrix of initial coordinates.
 
For spectral initializations, (`"spectral"`, `"normlaplacian"`,
`"laplacian"`, `"agspectral"`), if more than one connected
component is identified, no spectral initialization is attempted. Instead
a PCA-based initialization is attempted. If `verbose = TRUE` the
number of connected components are logged to the console. The existence of
multiple connected components implies that a global view of the data cannot
be attained with this initialization. Increasing the value of
`n_neighbors` may help.
- **`init_sdev`**: If non-`NULL`, scales each dimension of the initialized
coordinates (including any user-supplied matrix) to this standard
deviation. By default no scaling is carried out, except when `init =
"spca"`, in which case the value is `0.0001`. Scaling the input may
help if the unscaled versions result in initial coordinates with large
inter-point distances or outliers. This usually results in small gradients
during optimization and very little progress being made to the layout.
Shrinking the initial embedding by rescaling can help under these
circumstances. Scaling the result of `init = "pca"` is usually
recommended and `init = "spca"` as an alias for `init = "pca",
init_sdev = 1e-4` but for the spectral initializations the scaled versions
usually aren't necessary unless you are using a large value of
`n_neighbors` (e.g. `n_neighbors = 150` or higher). For
compatibility with recent versions of the Python UMAP package, if you are
using `init = "spectral"`, then you should also set
`init_sdev = "range"`, which will range scale each of the columns
containing the initial data between 0-10. This is not set by default to
maintain backwards compatibility with previous versions of uwot.
- **`set_op_mix_ratio`**: Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as
the set operation used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a
global fuzzy simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product
t-norm. The value of this parameter should be between `0.0` and
`1.0`; a value of `1.0` will use a pure fuzzy union, while
`0.0` will use a pure fuzzy intersection.
- **`local_connectivity`**: The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number
of nearest neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local
level. The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
dimension of the manifold.
- **`bandwidth`**: The effective bandwidth of the kernel if we view the
algorithm as similar to Laplacian Eigenmaps. Larger values induce more
connectivity and a more global view of the data, smaller values concentrate
more locally.
- **`repulsion_strength`**: Weighting applied to negative samples in low
dimensional embedding optimization. Values higher than one will result in
greater weight being given to negative samples.
- **`negative_sample_rate`**: The number of negative edge/1-simplex samples to
use per positive edge/1-simplex sample in optimizing the low dimensional
embedding.
- **`a`**: More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If `NULL`
these values are set automatically as determined by `min_dist` and
`spread`.
- **`b`**: More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If `NULL`
these values are set automatically as determined by `min_dist` and
`spread`.
- **`nn_method`**: Method for finding nearest neighbors. Options are:

   `"fnn"`. Use exact nearest neighbors via the
    [FNN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=FNN) package.
   `"annoy"` Use approximate nearest neighbors via the
    [RcppAnnoy](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy) package.
   `"hnsw"` Use approximate nearest neighbors with the
    Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method (Malkov and Yashunin,
    2018) via the
    [RcppHNSW](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppHNSW) package.
    `RcppHNSW` is not a dependency of this package: this option is
    only available if you have installed `RcppHNSW` yourself. Also,
    HNSW only supports the following arguments for `metric` and
    `target_metric`: `"euclidean"`, `"cosine"` and
    `"correlation"`.
   `"nndescent"` Use approximate nearest neighbors with the
    Nearest Neighbor Descent method (Dong et al., 2011) via the
    [rnndescent](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnndescent)
    package. `rnndescent` is not a dependency of this package: this
    option is only available if you have installed `rnndescent`
    yourself.
 
By default, if `X` has less than 4,096 vertices, the exact nearest
neighbors are found. Otherwise, approximate nearest neighbors are used.
You may also pass pre-calculated nearest neighbor data to this argument. It
must be one of two formats, either a list consisting of two elements:

   `"idx"`. A `n_vertices x n_neighbors` matrix
  containing the integer indexes of the nearest neighbors in `X`. Each
  vertex is considered to be its own nearest neighbor, i.e.
  `idx[, 1] == 1:n_vertices`.
   `"dist"`. A `n_vertices x n_neighbors` matrix
  containing the distances of the nearest neighbors.

or a sparse distance matrix of type `dgCMatrix`, with dimensions
`n_vertices x n_vertices`. Distances should be arranged by column,
i.e. a non-zero entry in row `j` of the `i`th column indicates
that the `j`th observation in `X` is a nearest neighbor of the
`i`th observation with the distance given by the value of that
element.
The `n_neighbors` parameter is ignored when using precomputed
nearest neighbor data. If using the sparse distance matrix input, each
column can contain a different number of neighbors.
- **`n_trees`**: Number of trees to build when constructing the nearest
neighbor index. The more trees specified, the larger the index, but the
better the results. With `search_k`, determines the accuracy of the
Annoy nearest neighbor search. Only used if the `nn_method` is
`"annoy"`. Sensible values are between `10` to `100`.
- **`search_k`**: Number of nodes to search during the neighbor retrieval. The
larger k, the more the accurate results, but the longer the search takes.
With `n_trees`, determines the accuracy of the Annoy nearest neighbor
search. Only used if the `nn_method` is `"annoy"`.
- **`approx_pow`**: If `TRUE`, use an approximation to the power function
in the UMAP gradient, from
<https://martin.ankerl.com/2012/01/25/optimized-approximative-pow-in-c-and-cpp/>.
Ignored if `dens_scale` is non-`NULL`.
- **`y`**: Optional target data for supervised dimension reduction. Can be a
vector, matrix or data frame. Use the `target_metric` parameter to
specify the metrics to use, using the same syntax as `metric`. Usually
either a single numeric or factor column is used, but more complex formats
are possible. The following types are allowed:
  
     Factor columns with the same length as `X`. `NA` is
    allowed for any observation with an unknown level, in which case
    UMAP operates as a form of semi-supervised learning. Each column is
    treated separately.
     Numeric data. `NA` is *not* allowed in this case. Use the
    parameter `target_n_neighbors` to set the number of neighbors used
    with `y`. If unset, `n_neighbors` is used. Unlike factors,
    numeric columns are grouped into one block unless `target_metric`
    specifies otherwise. For example, if you wish columns `a` and
    `b` to be treated separately, specify
    `target_metric = list(euclidean = "a", euclidean = "b")`. Otherwise,
    the data will be effectively treated as a matrix with two columns.
     Nearest neighbor data, consisting of a list of two matrices,
    `idx` and `dist`. These represent the precalculated nearest
    neighbor indices and distances, respectively. This
    is the same format as that expected for precalculated data in
    `nn_method`. This format assumes that the underlying data was a
    numeric vector. Any user-supplied value of the `target_n_neighbors`
    parameter is ignored in this case, because the the number of columns in
    the matrices is used for the value. Multiple nearest neighbor data using
    different metrics can be supplied by passing a list of these lists.
  
Unlike `X`, all factor columns included in `y` are automatically
used.
- **`target_n_neighbors`**: Number of nearest neighbors to use to construct the
target simplicial set. Default value is `n_neighbors`. Applies only if
`y` is non-`NULL` and `numeric`.
- **`target_metric`**: The metric used to measure distance for `y` if
using supervised dimension reduction. Used only if `y` is numeric.
- **`target_weight`**: Weighting factor between data topology and target
topology. A value of 0.0 weights entirely on data, a value of 1.0 weights
entirely on target. The default of 0.5 balances the weighting equally
between data and target. Only applies if `y` is non-`NULL`.
- **`pcg_rand`**: If `TRUE`, use the PCG random number generator (O'Neill,
2014) during optimization. Otherwise, use the faster (but probably less
statistically good) Tausworthe "taus88" generator. The default is
`TRUE`. This parameter has been superseded by `rng_type` -- if
both are set, `rng_type` takes precedence.
- **`fast_sgd`**: If `TRUE`, then the following combination of parameters
is set: `pcg_rand = TRUE`, `n_sgd_threads = "auto"` and
`approx_pow = TRUE`. The default is `FALSE`. Setting this to
`TRUE` will speed up the stochastic optimization phase, but give a
potentially less accurate embedding, and which will not be exactly
reproducible even with a fixed seed. For visualization, `fast_sgd =
TRUE` will give perfectly good results. For more generic dimensionality
reduction, it's safer to leave `fast_sgd = FALSE`. If `fast_sgd =
TRUE`, then user-supplied values of `pcg_rand`, `n_sgd_threads`,
and `approx_pow` are ignored.
- **`ret_model`**: If `TRUE`, then return extra data that can be used to
add new data to an existing embedding via `[umap_transform](uwot)`. The
embedded coordinates are returned as the list item `embedding`. If
`FALSE`, just return the coordinates. This parameter can be used in
conjunction with `ret_nn` and `ret_extra`. Note that some
settings are incompatible with the production of a UMAP model: external
neighbor data (passed via a list to `nn_method`), and factor columns
that were included via the `metric` parameter. In the latter case, the
model produced is based only on the numeric data. A transformation using
new data is possible, but the factor columns in the new data are ignored.
Note that setting `ret_model = TRUE` forces the use of the approximate
nearest neighbors method. Because small datasets would otherwise use exact
nearest neighbor calculations, setting `ret_model = TRUE` means that
different results may be returned for small datasets in terms of both the
returned nearest neighbors (if requested) and the final embedded
coordinates, compared to `ret_model = FALSE`, even if the random
number seed is fixed. To avoid this, explicitly set
`nn_method = "annoy"` in the `ret_model = FALSE` case.
- **`ret_nn`**: If `TRUE`, then in addition to the embedding, also return
nearest neighbor data that can be used as input to `nn_method` to
avoid the overhead of repeatedly calculating the nearest neighbors when
manipulating unrelated parameters (e.g. `min_dist`, `n_epochs`,
`init`). See the "Value" section for the names of the list items. If
`FALSE`, just return the coordinates. Note that the nearest neighbors
could be sensitive to data scaling, so be wary of reusing nearest neighbor
data if modifying the `scale` parameter. This parameter can be used in
conjunction with `ret_model` and `ret_extra`.
- **`ret_extra`**: A vector indicating what extra data to return. May contain
any combination of the following strings:

   `"model"` Same as setting `ret_model = TRUE`.
   `"nn"` Same as setting `ret_nn = TRUE`.
   `"fgraph"` the high dimensional fuzzy graph (i.e. the fuzzy
    simplicial set of the merged local views of the input data). The graph
    is returned as a sparse symmetric N x N matrix of class
    [dgCMatrix-class](Matrix), where a non-zero entry (i, j) gives the
    membership strength of the edge connecting vertex i and vertex j. This
    can be considered analogous to the input probability (or similarity or
    affinity) used in t-SNE and LargeVis. Note that the graph is further
    sparsified by removing edges with sufficiently low membership strength
    that they would not be sampled by the probabilistic edge sampling
    employed for optimization and therefore the number of non-zero elements
    in the matrix is dependent on `n_epochs`. If you are only
    interested in the fuzzy input graph (e.g. for clustering), setting
    `n_epochs = 0` will avoid any further sparsifying.
    Be aware that setting `binary_edge_weights = TRUE` will affect this
    graph (all non-zero edge weights will be 1).
  `"sigma"` the normalization value for each observation in the
    dataset when constructing the smoothed distances to each of its
    neighbors. This gives some sense of the local density of each
    observation in the high dimensional space: higher values of
    `sigma` indicate a higher dispersion or lower density.
- **`n_sgd_threads`**: Number of threads to use during stochastic gradient
descent. If set to > 1, then be aware that if `batch = FALSE`, results
will *not* be reproducible, even if `set.seed` is called with a
fixed seed before running. Set to `"auto"` to use the same value as
`n_threads`.
- **`grain_size`**: The minimum amount of work to do on each thread. If this
value is set high enough, then less than `n_threads` or
`n_sgd_threads` will be used for processing, which might give a
performance improvement if the overhead of thread management and context
switching was outweighing the improvement due to concurrent processing.
This should be left at default (`1`) and work will be spread evenly
over all the threads specified.
- **`tmpdir`**: Temporary directory to store nearest neighbor indexes during
nearest neighbor search. Default is `[tempdir]`. The index is
only written to disk if `n_threads > 1` and
`nn_method = "annoy"`; otherwise, this parameter is ignored.
- **`batch`**: If `TRUE`, then embedding coordinates are updated at the
end of each epoch rather than during the epoch. In batch mode, results are
reproducible with a fixed random seed even with `n_sgd_threads > 1`,
at the cost of a slightly higher memory use. You may also have to modify
`learning_rate` and increase `n_epochs`, so whether this provides
a speed increase over the single-threaded optimization is likely to be
dataset and hardware-dependent.
- **`opt_args`**: A list of optimizer parameters, used when
`batch = TRUE`. The default optimization method used is Adam (Kingma
and Ba, 2014).

   `method` The optimization method to use. Either `"adam"`
  or `"sgd"` (stochastic gradient descent). Default: `"adam"`.
   `beta1` (Adam only). The weighting parameter for the
  exponential moving average of the first moment estimator. Effectively the
  momentum parameter. Should be a floating point value between 0 and 1.
  Higher values can smooth oscillatory updates in poorly-conditioned
  situations and may allow for a larger `learning_rate` to be
  specified, but too high can cause divergence. Default: `0.5`.
   `beta2` (Adam only). The weighting parameter for the
  exponential moving average of the uncentered second moment estimator.
  Should be a floating point value between 0 and 1. Controls the degree of
  adaptivity in the step-size. Higher values put more weight on previous
  time steps. Default: `0.9`.
   `eps` (Adam only). Intended to be a small value to prevent
  division by zero, but in practice can also affect convergence due to its
  interaction with `beta2`. Higher values reduce the effect of the
  step-size adaptivity and bring the behavior closer to stochastic gradient
  descent with momentum. Typical values are between 1e-8 and 1e-3. Default:
  `1e-7`.
   `alpha` The initial learning rate. Default: the value of the
  `learning_rate` parameter.
- **`epoch_callback`**: A function which will be invoked at the end of every
epoch. Its signature should be: `(epoch, n_epochs, coords)`, where:

   `epoch` The current epoch number (between `1` and
  `n_epochs`).
   `n_epochs` Number of epochs to use during the optimization of
  the embedded coordinates.
   `coords` The embedded coordinates as of the end of the current
  epoch, as a matrix with dimensions (N, `n_components`).
- **`binary_edge_weights`**: If `TRUE` then edge weights in the input
graph are treated as binary (0/1) rather than real valued. This affects the
sampling frequency of neighbors and is the strategy used by the PaCMAP
method (Wang and co-workers, 2020). Practical (Böhm and co-workers, 2020)
and theoretical (Damrich and Hamprecht, 2021) work suggests this has little
effect on UMAP's performance.
- **`dens_scale`**: A value between 0 and 1. If > 0 then the output attempts
to preserve relative local density around each observation. This uses an
approximation to the densMAP method (Narayan and co-workers, 2021). The
larger the value of `dens_scale`, the greater the range of output
densities that will be used to map the input densities. This option is
ignored if using multiple `metric` blocks.
- **`nn_args`**: A list containing additional arguments to pass to the nearest
neighbor method. For `nn_method = "annoy"`, you can specify
`"n_trees"` and `"search_k"`, and these will override the
`n_trees` and `search_k` parameters.
For `nn_method = "hnsw"`, you may specify the following arguments:

 `M` The maximum number of neighbors to keep for each vertex.
Reasonable values are `2` to `100`. Higher values give better
recall at the cost of more memory. Default value is `16`.
 `ef_construction` A positive integer specifying the size of
the dynamic list used during index construction. A higher value will
provide better results at the cost of a longer time to build the index.
Default is `200`.
 `ef` A positive integer specifying the size of the dynamic
list used during search. This cannot be smaller than `n_neighbors`
and cannot be higher than the number of items in the index. Default is
`10`.

For `nn_method = "nndescent"`, you may specify the following
arguments:

 `n_trees` The number of trees to use in a random projection
forest to initialize the search. A larger number will give more accurate
results at the cost of a longer computation time. The default of
`NULL` means that the number is chosen based on the number of
observations in `X`.
 `max_candidates` The number of potential neighbors to explore
per iteration. By default, this is set to `n_neighbors` or `60`,
whichever is smaller. A larger number will give more accurate results at
the cost of a longer computation time.
 `n_iters` The number of iterations to run the search. A larger
number will give more accurate results at the cost of a longer computation
time. By default, this will be chosen based on the number of observations
in `X`. You may also need to modify the convergence criterion
`delta`.
 `delta` The minimum relative change in the neighbor graph
allowed before early stopping. Should be a value between 0 and 1. The
smaller the value, the smaller the amount of progress between iterations is
allowed. Default value of `0.001` means that at least 0.1
neighbor graph must be updated at each iteration.
 `init` How to initialize the nearest neighbor descent. By
default this is set to `"tree"` and uses a random project forest.
If you set this to `"rand"`, then a random selection is used. Usually
this is less accurate than using RP trees, but for high-dimensional cases,
there may be little difference in the quality of the initialization and
random initialization will be a lot faster. If you set this to
`"rand"`, then the `n_trees` parameter is ignored.
 `pruning_degree_multiplier` The maximum number of edges per node
to retain in the search graph, relative to `n_neighbors`. A larger
value will give more accurate results at the cost of a longer computation
time. Default is `1.5`. This parameter only affects neighbor search
when transforming new data with `[umap_transform](uwot)`.
 `epsilon` Controls the degree of the back-tracking when
traversing the search graph. Setting this to `0.0` will do a greedy
search with no back-tracking. A larger value will give more accurate
results at the cost of a longer computation time. Default is `0.1`.
This parameter only affects neighbor search when transforming new data with
`[umap_transform](uwot)`.
 `max_search_fraction` Specifies the maximum fraction of the
search graph to traverse. By default, this is set to `1.0`, so the
entire graph (i.e. all items in `X`) may be visited. You may want to
set this to a smaller value if you have a very large dataset (in
conjunction with `epsilon`) to avoid an inefficient exhaustive search
of the data in `X`. This parameter only affects neighbor search when
transforming new data with `[umap_transform](uwot)`.
- **`rng_type`**: The type of random number generator to use during
optimization. One of:

 `"pcg"`. Use the PCG random number generator (O'Neill, 2014).
 `"tausworthe"`. Use the Tausworthe "taus88" generator.
 `"deterministic"`. Use a deterministic number generator. This
 isn't actually random, but may provide enough variation in the negative
 sampling to give a good embedding and can provide a noticeable speed-up.

For backwards compatibility, by default this is unset and the choice of
`pcg_rand` is used (making "pcg" the effective default).

## Value

See `[umap](uwot)` for more information about these and
other parameters.
- Input for UMAP dimension reduction can be another dimension reduction
  (default = 'pca')
- To use gene expression as input set dim_reduction_to_use = NULL
- If dim_reduction_to_use = NULL, feats_to_use can be used to select a
  column name of highly variable features (see `[calculateHVF]`) or
  simply provide a vector of features
- multiple UMAP results can be stored by changing the *name* of
  the analysis
