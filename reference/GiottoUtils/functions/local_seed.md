# `local_seed` {#local_seed}

*Package:* `GiottoUtils`  
*Title:* Set a seed local to a call

## Description

When used inside a call, `local_seed()` first records the existing seed
then transiently sets a specific one. When the call exits, the recorded seed
is set again, so that the transient seed setting leaves no effects.  

Based on discussion from <https://support.bioconductor.org/p/110439/>

## Usage

```r
local_seed(seed)
```

## Arguments

- `seed`: seed value to set

## Value

set up seed passed to environment

## Examples

```r
f <- function() {
    local_seed(1234)
    r_val <- rnorm(1)
    return(r_val)
}

rnorm(1) # make sure a seed exists (not needed but handy for this example)

seed1 <- .Random.seed
x <- f()
seed2 <- .Random.seed
y <- rnorm(1)
seed3 <- .Random.seed
z <- f()

identical(seed1, seed2)
!identical(seed1, seed3)

identical(x, z)
!identical(x, y)
```
