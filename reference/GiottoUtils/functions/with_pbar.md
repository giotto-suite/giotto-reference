# `with_pbar` {#with_pbar}

*Package:* `GiottoUtils`  
*Title:* Track progress while evaluating an R expression

## Description

Track progress while evaluating an R expression. This is a wrapper around
`[progressr::with_progress()](progressr:with_progress)`. **progressr** is useful because it handles
progress reporting in parallel contexts. However, it is worth noting that
Giotto does not adhere to **progressr**'s guideline that `with_progress()`
should not be used within packages.
The default behavior of displaying progress is more convenient for end
users of packages with many functions. This implementation may shift over
time.

## Usage

```r
with_pbar(
  expr,
  handlers = progressr::handlers(),
  cleanup = TRUE,
  delay_terminal = NULL,
  delay_stdout = NULL,
  delay_conditions = NULL,
  interrupts = getOption("progressr.interrupts", TRUE),
  interval = NULL,
  enable = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `expr`: An R expression to evaluate.
- `handlers`: A progression handler or a list of them.
If NULL or an empty list, progress updates are ignored.
- `cleanup`: If TRUE, all progression handlers will be shutdown
at the end regardless of whether the progression is complete or not.
- `delay_terminal`: If TRUE, output and conditions that may end up in
the terminal will be delayed.
- `delay_stdout`: If TRUE, standard output is captured and relayed
at the end just before any captured conditions are relayed.
- `delay_conditions`: A character vector specifying [base::condition](base:conditions)
classes to be captured and relayed at the end after any captured
standard output is relayed.
- `interrupts`: Controls whether interrupts should be detected or not.
If TRUE and an interrupt is signaled, progress handlers are asked to
report on the current amount of progress when the evaluation was terminated
by the interrupt, e.g. when a user pressed Ctrl-C in an interactive session,
or a batch process was interrupted because it ran out of time.
Note that it's optional for a progress handler to support this and only
some do.
- `interval`: (numeric) The minimum time (in seconds) between
successive progression updates from handlers.
- `enable`: (logical) If FALSE, then progress is not reported.  The
default is to report progress in interactive mode but not batch mode.
See below for more details.

## Value

the result of the evaluated code

## Examples

```r
a <- function(x = 10) {
    with_pbar({
        pb <- pbar(x)
        for (i in seq_len(x)) {
            Sys.sleep(0.1)
            pb()
        }
    })
}

a()
```
