# `dir_manifest` {#dir_manifest}

*Package:* `GiottoUtils`  
*Title:* Generate file manifest list from a directory

## Description

Create a `list` of full filepaths (character) that are named
by with the respective [basename()]. Allows easy `$` exploration and
indexing of items.  

All params are directly passed to [list.files()] except
for `full.names`. [list.files()] also normally returns both actual files
and directories when `recursive = FALSE`, but this function specifically
tests if items are existing files and not directories with
`file_test(op = -f)` and fully obeys that flag in all cases.

## Usage

```r
dir_manifest(
  path = ".",
  pattern = NULL,
  all.files = FALSE,
  recursive = FALSE,
  ignore.case = FALSE,
  include.dirs = FALSE,
  no.. = FALSE,
  as.list = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- `path`: a character vector of full path names; the default corresponds
to the working directory, [getwd()]. Tilde expansion (see [path.expand])
and `[normalizePath()](=normalizePath)` are performed. Missing values will be ignored.
Elements with a marked encoding  will be converted to the native encoding
(and if that fails, considered non-existent).
- `pattern`: an optional regular expression. Only file names which match
the regular expression will be returned.
- `all.files`: a logical value. If `FALSE`, only the names of visible
files are returned (following Unix-style visibility, that is files whose
name does not start with a dot). If `TRUE`, all file names will be returned.
- `recursive`: logical. Should the listing recurse into directories?
- `ignore.case`: logical. Should pattern-matching be case-insensitive?
- `include.dirs`: logical. Should subdirectory names be included in
recursive listings?
- `no..`: logical. Should both `"."` and `".."` be excluded also from
non-recursive listings?
- `as.list`: logical. Should output be a list or a named character vector

## Value

full and normalized filepaths named by the file basename as either
a list (default) or if `as.list = FALSE`, a character vector.

## Examples

```r
dir_manifest()
```
