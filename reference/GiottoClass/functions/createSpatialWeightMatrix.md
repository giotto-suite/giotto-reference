# `createSpatialWeightMatrix` {#createSpatialWeightMatrix}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Create a spatial weight matrix

## Description

Generate spatial weight matrix based on the strength of spatial
interactions between nodes. Requires spatial networks to be first generated.

## Usage

```r
createSpatialWeightMatrix(
  gobject,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  spatial_network_to_use = "kNN_network",
  method = c("distance", "adjacency"),
  wm_name = "spat_weights",
  return_gobject = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `spat_unit`: spatial unit
- `spatial_network_to_use`: spatial network information to use
- `method`: type of weighted matrix to generate. See details
- `wm_name`: name to assign the weight matrix values
- `return_gobject`: (default = TRUE) whether to return as the giotto object
with attached results or the bare weighted matrix
- `verbose`: be verbose

## Value

spatial weight matrix

## Details

- `"distance"` method is calculated using 1/(1+distance) to
create an inverse weighting based on the distance between nodes.
- `"adjacency"` method is a binary matrix with 1 signifying that
two nodes are connected in the spatial network and 0 indicating that
they are not.

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")

createSpatialWeightMatrix(g, spatial_network_to_use = "spatial_network")
```
