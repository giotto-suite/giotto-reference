# `edge_distances` {#edge_distances}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Calculate network edge euclidean distances

## Description

Calculate network edge euclidean distances

## Usage

```r
edge_distances(x, y, x_node_ids = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: matrix of nodes info with coords. Rows should be samples, Cols
should be variables
- `y`: network data.table with `from` and `to` cols. Usually integer
indices matching the rows of x.
- `x_node_ids`: if y is indexed by character in from and to cols, then the
node IDs that apply to the coords in x must be supplied as a character vector

## Value

numeric

## Examples

```r
m <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
edges <- data.table::data.table(
    from = c(1, 1),
    to = c(2, 3)
)

edge_distances(m, edges)
```
