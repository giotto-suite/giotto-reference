  aggr_function = "sum",
  image_names = NULL,
  spat_locs_name = "raw",
  return_gobject = TRUE
)
```

- `name`: name for the overlap count matrix
- `poly_info`: polygon information
- `feat_info`: feature information
- `name_overlap`: name of the overlap
- `aggr_function`: function to aggregate image information (default = sum)
