# `calculateOverlapRaster` {#calculateOverlapRaster}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* calculateOverlapRaster

## Description

calculate overlap between cellular structures (polygons) and
features (points).

## Usage

```r
calculateOverlapRaster(
  gobject,
  name_overlap = NULL,
  spatial_info = NULL,
  poly_ID_names = NULL,
  feat_info = NULL,
  feat_subset_column = NULL,
  feat_subset_values = NULL,
  feat_count_column = NULL,
  return_gobject = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  feat_subset_ids = deprecated(),
  count_info_column = deprecated()
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `name_overlap`: name for the overlap
results (default to feat_info parameter)
- `spatial_info`: character. name polygon information
- `poly_ID_names`: (optional) list of poly_IDs to use
- `feat_info`: character. name of feature information
- `feat_subset_column`: feature info column to subset features with
- `feat_subset_values`: value(s) within feature info `feat_subset_column`
to use for subsetting
- `feat_count_column`: column with count information (optional)
- `return_gobject`: return giotto object (default: TRUE)
- `verbose`: be verbose
- `feat_subset_ids`: deprecated. Use `feat_subset_values` instead.
- `count_info_column`: deprecated. Use `feat_count_column` instead.

## Value

giotto object or spatVector with overlapping information
