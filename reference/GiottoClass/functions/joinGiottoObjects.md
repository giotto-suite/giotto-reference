*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Join giotto objects

## Description

Function to join multiple giotto objects together

## Usage

```r
joinGiottoObjects(
  gobject_list,
  gobject_names = NULL,
  join_method = c("shift", "z_stack", "no_change"),
  z_vals = 1000,
  x_shift = NULL,
  y_shift = NULL,
  x_padding = NULL,
  y_padding = NULL,
  dry_run = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject_list`: list of giotto objects
- `gobject_names`: unique giotto names for each giotto object
- `join_method`: method to join giotto objects, see details
- `z_vals`: distance(s) along z-axis if method is
z-stack (default is step of 1000)
- `x_shift`: numeric vector of values to shift along x-axis if method is
"shift"
- `y_shift`: numeric vector of values to shift along y-axis if method is
"shift"
- `x_padding`: x padding between datasets if method is shift
- `y_padding`: y padding between datasets if method is shift. Only applied
when y shifts are given.
- `dry_run`: logical. Plot expected object locations after join, but
do not actually perform it.
- `verbose`: be verbose
Preview where each gobject will be in space with bounding polygons

## Value

giotto object

## Details

This function joins both the expression and spatial information of
multiple giotto objects into a single one. Giotto supports multiple ways of
joining spatial information as selected through param `join_method`:
- **"shift"**
(default) Spatial locations of different datasets are shifted
by numeric vectors of values supplied through `x_shift`,
`y_shift`, `x_padding`, and `y_padding`. This is particularly useful
for data that is provided as tiles or ROIs or when analyzing multiple
spatial datasets together and keeping their spatial data separate.

**If shift values are given then a value is needed for each giotto
object to be joined in `gobject_list`. Order matters.**

If a regular step value is desired instead of a specific list of values,
use `x_padding` and `y_padding`. Both shift and padding values
can be used at the same time.

When `x_shift` is `NULL`, it defaults to the x range of gobjects in the
list so that datasets are xshifted exactly next to each other with no
overlaps. An additional default `x_padding = 1000` is applied if
`x_shift`, `x_padding`, `y_shift`, `y_padding` are all `NULL`.
- **"z_stack"**
Datasets are spatially combined with no change to x and y
spatial locations, but a z value is incorporated for each dataset based
on input supplied through param `z_vals`. To specify a z value for
each dataset to join, a numeric vector must be given with a value for
each element in `gobject_list`. Order matters.

Alternatively, a single numeric value can be supplied to `z_vals`
in which case this input will be treated as a z step value.
- **"no_change"**
No changes are applied to the spatial locations of the datasets when
joining.

## Examples

```r
# joining objects with no spatial information
m1 <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
m2 <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
colnames(m1) <- paste0("cell_", seq_len(10))
colnames(m2) <- paste0("cell_", seq_len(10))
rownames(m1) <- rownames(m2) <- paste0("feat_", seq_len(10))

g1 <- createGiottoObject(expression = m1)
g2 <- createGiottoObject(expression = m2)

joinGiottoObjects(
    gobject_list = list(g1, g2),
    gobject_names = c("g1", "g2")
)

# dry run joining objects with spatial information
# a default x_padding of 1000 is applied
viz <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("viz")
joinGiottoObjects(
    list(viz, viz),
    gobject_names = c("v1", "v2"),
    dry_run = TRUE
)

# place them right next to each other
# note that this means generated spatial networks will be more likely to
# link across the datasets
joinGiottoObjects(
    list(viz, viz),
    gobject_names = c("v1", "v2"),
    dry_run = TRUE,
    x_padding = 0
)

# join the spatial objects
joined_viz <- joinGiottoObjects(
    list(viz, viz),
    gobject_names = c("v1", "v2")
)
```
