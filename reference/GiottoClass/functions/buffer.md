# `buffer` {#buffer}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Create a buffer around vector geometries
*Aliases:* `buffer,spatLocsObj-method`, `buffer,giottoPoints-method`, `buffer,giottoPolygon-method`

## Description

Calculate a buffer around all geometries of a `SpatVector`

## Usage

```r
buffer,spatLocsObj-method(x, width, ..., settle = TRUE)

buffer,giottoPoints-method(x, width, ..., settle = TRUE)

buffer,giottoPolygon-method(x, width, ..., settle = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: SpatRaster or SpatVector
- `width`: numeric. Unit is meter if `x` has a longitude/latitude CRS, or in the units of the coordinate reference system in other cases (typically also meter). The value should be > 0 if `x` is a SpatRaster. If `x` is a SpatVector, this argument is vectorized, meaning that you can provide a different value for each geometry in `x`; and you can also use the name of a variable in `x` that has the widths
- `...`: additional params to pass
- `settle`: logical. Settle the borders between polygons by cutting them
where they touch based on voronoi boundaries.

## Value

`giottoPolygon` of buffer polygons

## Examples

```r
sl <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("spatLocsObj")
slb <- buffer(sl, 30)
plot(slb)
```
