## Arguments

- `x`: giotto image, giottoPolygon, or giottoPoints object
- `y`: Not used.
- `...`: additional parameters to pass
- `col`: character. Colors. The default is
grDevices::grey.colors(n = 256, start = 0, end = 1, gamma = 1)
- `mar`: numeric vector of length 4 to set the margins of the plot
(to make space for the legend). The default is (3, 5, 1.5, 1)
- `ext`: object that works with `ext()`. Set the spatial extent of the
plot.
- `xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax`: (optional) `numeric`. xy minmax ranges to use
when plotting. If `ext` is also provided, these are applied afterwards.
- `legend`: logical or character. If not `FALSE` a legend is drawn. The character value can be used to indicate where the legend is to be drawn. For example "topright" or "bottomleft". Use `plg` for more refined placement. Not supported for continuous legends (the default for raster data)
- `asRGB`: (optional) logical. Force RGB plotting if not automatically
detected
- `smooth`: logical. If `TRUE` the cell values are smoothed (only if a continuous legend is used)
- `axes`: logical. Draw axes?
- `plg`: list with parameters for drawing the legend. See the arguments for `[legend](graphics)`. 
 
  A legend can be placed with placed by specifying arguments `x` and `y`. For a continuous legend `y` can have two values. `x` can also be a SpatExtent. Furthermore, `x` can have be a keyword such "topleft" and "bottomright" to place the legend at these locations inside the map rectangle. For a continuous legend, only the placement keywords "left", "right", "top", "bottom", "topright", "bottomright" are recognized; and when using these keywords, the legend is placed outside of the map rectangle. The placement of the legend can be altered with argument `nudge` that move the location in the directions specified with one value (x direction) or two values (x, y). For a continuous legend it can also have four values (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax). When supplying coordinates, use `horiz=TRUE` to get a horizontal legend.
    
  Additional parameters for continuous legends include: 

  - `digits` integer. The number of digits to print after the decimal point
- `size` to change the height and/or width; the defaults are `c(1,1)`
- `at` to set the location of the tickmarks
- `format` as in `[formatC]` to format the numbers. For example, you can use `format="g"` for scientific notation. The default is `"f"`
- `tick` One of these partially matched values: "through", "in", "middle", "out", or "none", to choose a tickmark placement/length that is different from the default "throughout".
- `tick.length` to change the tickmark length (default = 1). Only relevant when `tick` is "throughout" or "out".
- `tick.col`, `tick.box.col` and `tick.lwd` to change the appearance of the tickmarks
- `title.srt` to rotate the legend title
- `title.x` and `title.y` to place the legend title at specific coordinates
- `maxcell`: positive integer. Maximum number of cells to use for the plot
- `max_intensity`: (optional) value to treat as maximum intensity in
color scale. Overridden by `range` param
- `range`: numeric. minimum and maximum values to be used for the continuous legend. You can use `NA` for one of these to only set the minimum or maximum value
- `fill_range`: logical. If `TRUE`, values outside of `range` get the colors of the extreme values; otherwise they get colored as `NA`
- `levels`: character. labels for the legend when `type="classes"`
- `all_levels`: logical. If `TRUE`, the legend shows all levels of a categorical raster, even if they are not present in the data
- `breaks`: numeric. Either a single number to indicate the number of breaks desired, or the actual breaks. When providing this argument, the default legend becomes "interval"
- `breakby`: character or function. Either "eqint" for equal interval breaks, "cases" for equal quantile breaks. If a function is supplied, it should take a single argument (a vector of values) and create groups
- `fun`: function to be called after plotting each SpatRaster layer to add something to each map (such as text, legend, lines). For example, with SpatVector `v`, you could do `fun=function() lines(v)`. The function may have one argument, representing the layer that is plotted (1 to the number of layers)
- `colNA`: character. color for the NA values
- `alpha`: Either a single numeric between 0 and 1 to set the transparency for all colors (0 is transparent, 1 is opaque) or a SpatRaster with values between 0 and 1 to set the transparency by cell. To set the transparency for a given color, set it to the colors directly
- `sort`: logical. If `TRUE` legends with categorical values are sorted. If `x` is a `SpatVector` you can also supply a vector of the unique values, in the order in which you want them to appear in the legend
- `reverse`: logical. If `TRUE`, the legend order is reversed
- `grid`: logical. If `TRUE` grid lines are drawn. Their properties such as type and color can be set with the `pax` argument. The grid is drawn first such that it is covered by `x`. See `[add_grid](terra)` to add grid lines on top of the map
- `zebra`: logical. If `TRUE` a "zebra-box" is added to the axes (ignored when `add=TRUE`). The width of the zebra-box can be set with additional argument `zebra.cex`. The colors can be changed with additional argument `zebra.col`
- `reset`: logical. If `TRUE` the margins (see argument `mar`) are reset to what they were before calling plot; doing so may affect the display of additional objects that are added to the map (e.g. with  `[lines](terra)`)
- `add`: logical. If `TRUE` add the object to the current plot
- `buffer`: logical. If `TRUE` the plotting area is made slightly larger than the extent of `x`
- `background`: background color. Default is no color (white)
- `box`: logical. Should a box be drawn around the map?
- `clip`: logical. Should the axes be clipped to the extent of `x`?
- `point_size`: size of points when plotting giottoPoints
- `type`: what to plot: either 'poly' (default) or polygon 'centroid'
- `max_poly`: numeric. If `type` is not specified, maximum number of
polygons to plot before automatically switching to centroids plotting.
Default is 1e4. This value is settable using options("giotto.plot_max_poly")
- `feats`: specific features to plot within giottoPoints object
(defaults to NULL, meaning all available features)
- `raster`: default = TRUE, whether to plot points as rasterized plot with
size based on `raster_size` param. See details. When `FALSE`, plots via
`[terra::plot()](terra:plot)`
- `raster_size`: Default is 600. Only used when `raster` is TRUE
- `count`: `logical`. Show point density using `count` statistic per
rasterized cell. (Default = TRUE) This param affects `col` param
defaults. When TRUE, `col` is `grDevices::hcl.colors(256)`. When `FALSE`,
"black" and "white" are used.
- `sigma`: `numeric` (default = NULL). Amount of smoothing when
`count = TRUE`. Set `NULL` for no smoothing.
Larger values can take a while.
- `dims`: dimensions to plot

## Value

## Details

*[giottoPoints raster plotting]*
Fast plotting of points information by rasterizing the information using
`[terra::rasterize()](terra:rasterize)`. For **terra** `SpatVectors`, this is faster than
**scattermore** plotting. When plotting as a raster, `col` colors map on
whole image level, as opposed to mapping to individual points, as it does
when `raster = FALSE`
Allows the following additional params when
plotting with no specific `feats` input:
- **force_size** logical. `raster_size` param caps at 1:1 with the
spatial extent, but also with a minimum resulting px dim of 100. To ignore
these constraints, set `force_size = FALSE`
- **background** (optional) background color. Usually not used when a
`col` color mapping is sufficient.


Note that `col` param and other `[base::plot()](base:plot)` graphical params are available
through `...`

## Examples

```r
######### giottoLargeImage plotting #########

gimg <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("giottoLargeImage")

plot(gimg, col = grDevices::hcl.colors(256))
plot(gimg, max_intensity = 100)


######### giottoPolygon plotting #########

######### giottoPoints plotting #########
gpoints <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("giottoPoints")

# ----- rasterized plotting ----- #
# plot points binary

# plotting all features maps colors on an image level
plot(gpoints, col = grDevices::hcl.colors(n = 256)) # only 2 colors are used

# plot points density (by count)
plot(gpoints, raster_size = 300)
plot(gpoints, raster_size = 300, sigma = 4)

# force_size = TRUE to ignore default constraints on too big or too small
# (see details)
plot(gpoints, raster_size = 80, force_size = TRUE)

# plot specific feature(s)
plot(gpoints, feats = featIDs(gpoints)[seq_len(4)])

# ----- vector plotting ----- #

plot(gpoints, raster = FALSE)

# vector plotting maps colors to transcripts
plot(gpoints, raster = FALSE, col = grDevices::rainbow(nrow(gpoints)))

# plot specific feature(s)
plot(gpoints, feats = featIDs(gpoints)[seq_len(4)], raster = FALSE)
