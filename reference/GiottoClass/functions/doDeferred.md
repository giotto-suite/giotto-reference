# `doDeferred` {#doDeferred}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Perform deferred/lazy operations
*Aliases:* `doDeferred,giottoAffineImage-method`

## Description

Force deferred/lazy operations.

## Usage

```r
doDeferred,giottoAffineImage-method(x, size = 5e+05, filename = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: object to force deferred operations in
- `size`: numeric. Minimum number of image pixels to render when
evaluating
- `filename`: character. Full filepath to write the rendered image to. If
`NULL`, a file in `tempdir()` will be generated.
- `...`: additional args to pass

## Value

giottoLargeImage

## Examples

```r
gimg <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("giottoLargeImage")
affimg <- spin(gimg, 45) # lazily performs affine

# force the affine operation and render the output with at least 5e5 px
gimg2 <- doDeferred(affimg, size = 5e5)
# **This is mainly intended for visualization.**
# This process saves with image depth of 8.
# Spatially transformed raster values are not preferred for analysis
```
