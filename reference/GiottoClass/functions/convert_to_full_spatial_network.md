# `convert_to_full_spatial_network` {#convert_to_full_spatial_network}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* convert_to_full_spatial_network

## Description

Convert to a full spatial network, ie ensuring that all edges
that may currently only be represented as `a` -> `b` also have the
reverse `b` -> `a`. The entries are then made unique, after which all
interactions are ranked by distance, where rank increases from smaller to
larger distances. This rank is appended to the `data.table` as a `rank_int`
column. Another `rnk_src_trgt` column is added with the IDs of `a` and
`b` pasted together

## Usage

```r
convert_to_full_spatial_network(reduced_spatial_network_DT)
```

## Arguments

- `reduced_spatial_network_DT`: reduced spatial network in `data.table`
format

## Value

data.table

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")
spat_net <- getSpatialNetwork(g, output = "networkDT")

spat_net_full <- convert_to_full_spatial_network(spat_net)
```
