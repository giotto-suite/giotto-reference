# `createSpatialNetwork` {#createSpatialNetwork}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Create spatial network

## Description

Create a spatial network based on cell centroids. These networks
are often used when determining cell-cell connectivities and spatial
relationships.
There are several types of spatial networks and multiple methods to generate
them. Method-specific params are labeled with the name of the method within
parentheses in their descriptions.

## Usage

```r
createSpatialNetwork(
  gobject,
  name = NULL,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  spat_loc_name = NULL,
  dimensions = "all",
  method = c("Delaunay", "kNN"),
  delaunay_method = c("deldir", "delaunayn_geometry", "RTriangle"),
  maximum_distance_delaunay = "auto",
  options = "Pp",
  Y = TRUE,
  j = TRUE,
  S = 0,
  minimum_k = 0,
  knn_method = "dbscan",
  k = 4,
  maximum_distance_knn = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  return_gobject = TRUE,
  output = c("spatialNetworkObj", "data.table"),
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `name`: name for spatial network (default = 'spatial_network')
- `spat_unit`: spatial unit
- `feat_type`: feature type
- `spat_loc_name`: name of spatial locations to use
- `dimensions`: which spatial dimensions to use (default = all)
- `method`: which method to use to create a spatial
network. (default = Delaunay)
- `delaunay_method`: method to use to generate Delaunay network
- `maximum_distance_delaunay`: distance cutoff for nearest neighbors to
consider for Delaunay network. If "auto", "upper whisker" value of the
distance vector between neighbors is used; see the [grDevices::boxplot.stats](grDevices:boxplot.stats)
documentation for more details.(default = "auto")
- `options`: (geometry) String containing extra control options for the
underlying Qhull command; see the
[Qhull documentation](http://www.qhull.org/html/qdelaun.htm) for the
available options. (default = 'Pp', do not report precision problems)
- `Y`: (RTriangle) If TRUE prohibits the insertion of Steiner points on
the mesh boundary.
- `j`: (RTriangle) If TRUE jettisons vertices that are not part of the
final triangulation from the output.
- `S`: (RTriangle) Specifies the maximum number of added Steiner points.
- `minimum_k`: minimum nearest neighbours if maximum_distance != NULL
- `knn_method`: method to create kNN network
- `k`: number of nearest neighbors based on physical distance
- `maximum_distance_knn`: distance cutoff for nearest neighbors to consider
for kNN network
- `verbose`: be verbose
- `return_gobject`: logical. return giotto object (default = TRUE)
- `output`: character. Object type to return spatial network as when
`return_gobject = FALSE`. (default: 'spatialNetworkObj')
- `...`: Additional parameters for the selected function

## Value

giotto object with updated spatial network slot

## Details

Creates a spatial network connecting single-cells based on their
physical distance to each other.
For Delaunay method, neighbors will be decided by Delaunay triangulation and
a maximum distance criteria. For kNN method, number of neighbors can be
determined by k, or maximum distance from each cell with or without
setting a minimum k for each cell.

**dimensions: ** default = 'all' which takes all possible dimensions.
Alternatively you can provide a character vector that specifies the spatial
dimensions to use, e.g. c("sdimx', "sdimy") or a numerical vector, e.g. 2:3

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")

createSpatialNetwork(g)
```
