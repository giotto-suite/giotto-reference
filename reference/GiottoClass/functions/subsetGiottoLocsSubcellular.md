# `subsetGiottoLocsSubcellular` {#subsetGiottoLocsSubcellular}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Subset raw subcellular information by location

## Description

Subsets Giotto object based on spatial coordinates. This
subset function is intended for poly_info and feat_types for which there
are no matching aggregated information.

## Usage

```r
subsetGiottoLocsSubcellular(
  gobject,
  poly_info = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  x_min = NULL,
  x_max = NULL,
  y_min = NULL,
  y_max = NULL,
  z_max = NULL,
  z_min = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: giotto object
- `poly_info`: character. which polygons to spatially subset
- `feat_type`: character. which feature info to spatially subset
- `x_max, x_min, y_max, y_min, z_max, z_min`: minimum and maximum x, y, and z
coordinates to subset to
- `verbose`: be verbose

## Value

giotto object

## Details

This is separate from [subsetGiottoLocs] because spat_units with attached
aggregated information should be removed using a cell_ids-based approach in
order to ensure that paired information is removed together. Polygons and
points information without associated aggregated values do not have this
issue and can be directly spatially subset.
