# `tessellate` {#tessellate}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Tessellated grid of polygons
*Aliases:* `tesselate`

## Description

Generates a tessellated grid of polygons within the provided
spatial extent

## Usage

```r
tessellate(
  extent,
  shape = c("hexagon", "square"),
  shape_size = NULL,
  gap = 0,
  radius = NULL,
  id_prefix = "ID_",
  name = "grid"
)
```

## Arguments

- `extent`: SpatExtent or anything else a SpatExtent can be extracted or
created from
- `shape`: Shape of the tessellation grid. Available options are "hexagon"
and "square".
- `shape_size`: numeric. Size of shape to tessellate. (x-axis width for
hexagons, side length for squares)
- `gap`: numeric. Shrink polygons to add a gap between tessellated
polygons. See details
- `radius`: deprecated. numeric. Radius size of the tessellation grid.
- `id_prefix`: character. prefix to add to poly_ID names generated
- `name`: name of giottoPolygons grid to make

## Value

A giottoPolygon

## Details

This function generates a tessellated grid of spatial locations
based on the input spatial locations. The `shape` of the tessellation grid
can be either hexagonal or square. The `shape_size` parameter determines the
size of the grid cells or the bin size. Applying a `gap` will not change the
center to center distance or change centroid location. For example, a
square tessellation with `shape_size` of 10 and `gap` of 9 will produce 1x1
polygons with size 9 gutter space between polys.

## Examples

```r
# Create an extent across which to generate tessellated polygons
e <- ext(0, 100, 0, 100)
# produce hexagons with a diameter of 10
x <- tessellate(extent = e, shape = "hexagon", shape_size = 10)
plot(x)

# same size grid, but now with a gap
x <- tessellate(extent = e, shape = "hexagon", shape_size = 10, gap = 1)
plot(x)

# square grid with a gap
x <- tessellate(extent = e, shape = "square", shape_size = 10, gap = 1)
plot(x)
```
