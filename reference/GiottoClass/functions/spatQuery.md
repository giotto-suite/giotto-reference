# `spatQuery` {#spatQuery}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Spatial Query
*Aliases:* `spatQueryGiottoPolygons`

## Description

Select spatial geometries based on a list of spatial `filters`.
The final item in provided in the list is the layer of information
being queried.  

By default, results will be returned as a new polygon-based spatial unit
with selection information recorded in the associated cell metadata.   

Spatial queries may perform queries on the geometries themselves, so
`intersect()` operations are performed under the hood. For a lighter weight
option that just finds spatial relationships, see `[relate()](=relate)`

## Usage

```r
spatQuery(
  gobject,
  filters,
  name = "query_polys",
  clip = TRUE,
  use_centroids = NULL,
  buffer = 0,
  make_valid = FALSE,
  combine_fragments = FALSE,
  dissolve = FALSE,
  return_table = FALSE,
  return_ids = FALSE,
  return_gobject = TRUE,
  verbose = NULL
)

spatQueryGiottoPolygons(
  gobject,
  filters,
  name = "query_polys",
  clip = TRUE,
  use_centroids = NULL,
  buffer = 0,
  make_valid = FALSE,
  combine_fragments = FALSE,
  dissolve = FALSE,
  return_table = FALSE,
  return_ids = FALSE,
  return_gobject = TRUE,
  verbose = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: `giotto` object
- `filters`: named list of characters and/or `giottoPolygons` to use as
spatial filters for the final item in the list.
- [`character`] list name designates the gobject spatial unit to use as a
filter. The actual character values should either be `"all"` or a specific
vector of cell_IDs to use.
- [`giottoPolygon`] inputs are directly used as filters. List names are
used when reporting the spatial relationships in output geometry objects.
These can also be used as centroids and additionally can be buffered.
- [`SpatVector`] inputs are directly used. Can also be converted to
centroids and/or buffered.
- [`numeric`] input is read as XY pairs (e.g. `c(x1, y1, x2, y2, ...)`),
to be used as centroids. These are bufferable.
- ['spatLocsObj'] inputs are directly used as centroids. These are
bufferable.
- `name`: (optional) character. If not `NULL`, a new spatial unit of this
name will be generated from the results.
- `clip`: logical. Default = `TRUE`. Whether final round of querying should
produce polygons clipped by the polygons used to select them.
- `use_centroids`: character vector. Values must correspond to names in
`filters`. Selected `filters` will be converted to centroids. (prefers
usage of the first set of spatlocs for that spat_unit)
- `buffer`: numeric. Or named vector of numerics. Names must correspond to
those in `centroids`. Applies the specified buffer to the centroid to allow
it to be used in `filter`. A `0` will skip buffering, but this is only
permitted if is also the the last item in `filter`. Unbuffered points may
only return results as IDs (`return_ids = TRUE`). Do note that buffering on
a large number of elements can cause significant slowdowns.
- `make_valid`: logical (default = `FALSE`). Whether to make geometries
valid before using them. Set `TRUE` if topology errors show up.
- `combine_fragments`: logical. (default = `FALSE`). Whether to combine
geoms fragmented by the intersections as multipolygons based on the
`poly_ID` col. If `TRUE`, the operation may introduce `NA`s in the spatial
relationship information.
- `dissolve`: logical. (default = `FALSE`). If `combine_fragments = TRUE`,
whether to also merge the multipolygon into a single polygon.
- `return_table`: logical. (Default = `FALSE`) Overrides `return__object`.
If `TRUE`, return only the relationships as a `data.table`
- `return_ids`: logical. (Default = `FALSE`) Overrides `return_gobject`.
If `TRUE`, return only the poly_IDs of the final entry in `filters`
- `return_gobject`: logical. (Default = TRUE). Whether to return the new
set of polygons attached to the giotto object.
- `verbose`: verbosity

## Value

`character` (IDs), `giottoPolygon`, or `giotto` depending on
`return_ids` and `return_gobject`.
