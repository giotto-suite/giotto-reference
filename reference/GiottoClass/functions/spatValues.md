# `spatValues` {#spatValues}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Giotto object spatial values
*Aliases:* `svkey`

## Description

Retrieve specific values from the `giotto` object for a specific `spat_unit`
and `feat_type`. Values are returned as a data.table with the features
requested and a `cell_ID` column. This function may be updated in the future
to search in additional sets of information. To see the currently available
slot it checks, see details.

## Usage

```r
spatValues(
  gobject,
  feats,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  expression_values = NULL,
  spat_loc_name = NULL,
  spat_enr_name = NULL,
  poly_info = NULL,
  dim_reduction_to_use = NULL,
  dim_reduction_name = NULL,
  svkey = NULL,
  verbose = NULL,
  debug = FALSE
)

svkey(
  feats,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  expression_values = NULL,
  spat_loc_name = NULL,
  poly_info = NULL,
  dim_reduction_to_use = NULL,
  dim_reduction_name = NULL,
  verbose = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: `giotto` object
- `feats`: character vector. One or more features or values to find within
the giotto object
- `spat_unit`: character. spatial unit to check
- `feat_type`: character. feature type to check
- `expression_values`: character. (optional) Name of expression information
to use
- `spat_loc_name`: character. (optional) Name of spatial locations
information to use
- `spat_enr_name`: character. (optional) Name of spatial enrichments to
use
- `poly_info`: character. (optional) Name of polygons to use
- `dim_reduction_to_use`: character. (optional) Which type of dimension
reduction to use
- `dim_reduction_name`: character. (optional) Name of dimension reduction
to use
- `svkey`: use a `svkey`. Other params will be ignored. This is just
syntactic sugar for `svkey@get(gobject)`
- `verbose`: verbosity
- `debug`: logical. (default = FALSE) See details.

## Value

A data.table with a cell_ID column and whichever feats were
requested

## Details

**[search]**  

spatValues searches through the set of available information within the
`giotto` object for matches to `feats`. The current search order is
1. cell expression
1. cell metadata
1. spatial locations
1. spatial enrichment
1. dimension reduction
1. polygon info

If a specific name for one of the types of information is provided via a
param such as `expression_values`, `spat_enr_name`, etc, then
the search will only be performed on that type of data.  
  

**[debug]**  

This function uses Giotto's accessor functions which can usually throw errors
whenever a specific set of data or the features within that set do not
exist. This function muffles those errors, and only sends an error that the
data was not found when all getters fail. By setting `debug = TRUE`, you can
see the errors returned from each failed getter printed as messages for
easier debugging.

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("vizgen")

# expression
spatValues(g, spat_unit = "aggregate", feats = c("Mlc1", "Gfap"))
spatValues(g,
    spat_unit = "aggregate", feats = c("Mlc1", "Gfap"),
    expression_values = "normalized"
)

# spatial enrichment
spatValues(g, spat_unit = "aggregate", feats = c("1", "3"))

# polygon info
spatValues(g, spat_unit = "aggregate", feats = c("agg_n", "valid"))

# cell meta
spatValues(g, spat_unit = "aggregate", feats = c("nr_feats"))
```
