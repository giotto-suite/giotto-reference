# `aggregateFeatures` {#aggregateFeatures}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Aggregate Spatial Features Covered by Polygon Geometries

## Description

Aggregate features (either `feat_info` OR `image_names`) with
polygons (`spat_info`). Under the hood, this is performed in two steps:
1. Find the overlapped features via the lower-level generic
`[calculateOverlap()](=calculateOverlap)`
1. Summarize the overlapped features as a matrix via `[overlapToMatrix()](=overlapToMatrix)`

## Usage

```r
aggregateFeatures(
  gobject,
  spat_info = NULL,
  feat_info = NULL,
  image_names = NULL,
  new_spat_unit = NULL,
  new_feat_type = NULL,
  name = "raw",
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  feat_subset_column = NULL,
  feat_subset_values = NULL,
  feat_count_column = NULL,
  fun = "sum",
  return_gobject = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- `gobject`: `giotto` object containing spatial data to aggregate.
- `spat_info`: character. Name of polygon information to use to aggregate
features with.
- `feat_info`: character. Name of feature point detections to be
aggregated.
- `image_names`: character. Name of image(s) containing intensity values
to be aggregated.
- `new_spat_unit`: character (optional). Name of spatial unit to assign
the expression info to. Default is the same as `spat_info`.
- `new_feat_type`: character (optional). Name of feature type to assign
the expression info to. Default is the same as `feat_info` when used. When
`image_names` is used instead, default is "protein".
- `name`: character. (default = "raw") Name to assign the output
expresssion values information.
- `poly_subset_ids`: character vector. (optional) Specific poly_IDs to use
- `feat_subset_column`: character. (optional) feature info attribute to
subset feature points on when performing overlap calculation.
- `feat_subset_values`: (optional) values matched against
in `feat_subset_column` in order to subset feature points when performing
overlap calculation.
- `feat_count_column`: character. (optional) feature info column with counts
information. Useful in cases when more than one detection is reported per
point.
- `fun`: character (default = "sum"). A function usable by
`[exactextractr::exact_extract()](exactextractr:exact_extract)` to aggregate image intensity values.
- `return_gobject`: logical (default = TRUE). Whether to return the
`giotto` object or just the aggregated expression values as `exprObj` class.
- `verbose`: logical. Whether to be verbose.
- `...`: Additional params to pass to the overlap calculation method.
None implemented for point overlaps. For intensity overlaps, passes to
`[exactextractr::exact_extract()](exactextractr:exact_extract)` and additionally the function requested
with the `fun` param.

## Value

`giotto` when `return_gobject=TRUE`, `exprObj` when
`return_gobject=FALSE`

## Details

`feat_subset_column`, `feat_subset_values`, and `feat_count_column`
are specific to overlaps on feature points info, and should not be provided
when overlapping image data.
