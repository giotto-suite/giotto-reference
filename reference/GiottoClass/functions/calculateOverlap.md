# `calculateOverlap` {#calculateOverlap}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Calculate features overlapped by polygons
*Aliases:* `calculateOverlap,giotto,missing-method`, `calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,giottoPoints-method`, `calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,giottoLargeImage-method`, `calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,giottoAffineImage-method`, `calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,SpatRaster-method`, `calculateOverlap,SpatVector,SpatRaster-method`, `calculateOverlap,SpatVector,SpatVector-method`

## Description

Calculate subcellular points/feature info or image values overlapped by
polygon annotations. This provides a summary of the spatial data overlapped
by the polygon which can be further processed to become an expression matrix.

## Usage

```r
calculateOverlap,giotto,missing-method(
  x,
  name_overlap = NULL,
  spat_info = NULL,
  feat_info = NULL,
  image_names = NULL,
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  return_gobject = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  spatial_info = deprecated(),
  ...
)

calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,giottoPoints-method(
  x,
  y,
  name_overlap = NULL,
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  feat_subset_column = NULL,
  feat_subset_values = NULL,
  feat_count_column = NULL,
  return_gpolygon = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  feat_subset_ids = deprecated(),
  count_info_column = deprecated(),
  ...
)

calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,giottoLargeImage-method(
  x,
  y,
  name_overlap = NULL,
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  return_gpolygon = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)

calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,giottoAffineImage-method(
  x,
  y,
  name_overlap = NULL,
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  return_gpolygon = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)

calculateOverlap,giottoPolygon,SpatRaster-method(
  x,
  y,
  name_overlap = NULL,
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  return_gpolygon = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)

calculateOverlap,SpatVector,SpatRaster-method(
  x,
  y,
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  fun = "sum",
  ...
)

calculateOverlap,SpatVector,SpatVector-method(
  x,
  y,
  poly_subset_ids = NULL,
  feat_subset_column = NULL,
  feat_subset_values = NULL,
  feat_count_column = NULL,
  method = getOption("giotto.overlap_point_method", "vector"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  feat_subset_ids = deprecated(),
  count_info_column = deprecated()
)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: Object with spatial annotations: `giottoPolygon`, or `SpatVector`
polygons. Can also be a `giotto` object
- `name_overlap`: name for the overlap
results (default to feat_info parameter)
- `feat_info`: character. Name of vector feature information to overlap
- `image_names`: character vector. Name(s) of the image feature information
to overlap
- `poly_subset_ids`: character vector. (optional) Specific poly_IDs to use
- `return_gobject`: return giotto object (default: TRUE)
- `verbose`: be verbose
- `spatial_info`: character. Name polygon information
- `...`: additional params to pass to methods.
- `y`: Object with features to overlap: `giottoPoints`, `giottoLargeImage`,
`SpatVector` points or `SpatRaster`
- `feat_subset_column`: character. (optional) feature info attribute to
subset feature points on when performing overlap calculation.
- `feat_subset_values`: (optional) values matched against
in `feat_subset_column` in order to subset feature points when performing
overlap calculation.
- `feat_count_column`: character. (optional) column with count information.
Useful in cases when more than one detection is reported per point. If a
column called "count" is present in the feature points data, it will be
automatically selected.
- `return_gpolygon`: default = TRUE. Whether to return the entire
giottoPolygon provided to `x`, but with the overlaps information appended or
as a bare terra `SpatVector`
- `feat_subset_ids`: deprecated. Use `feat_subset_values` instead.
- `count_info_column`: deprecated. Use `feat_count_column` instead.
- `method`: character. One of `"vector"` or `"raster"`,
(default = `"vector"`). Method for polygon-point feature overlap calculation.
Can also set as an option: `"giotto.overlap_point_method"`
- `"vector"` uses direct spatial extraction (more accurate to input geometry,
will double count features in overlapping polygon regions for all overlapping
polygons).
- `"raster"` uses rasterization (faster, assigns each feature to only one
polygon even in overlapping regions as a byproduct of the rasterization).

## Value

Usually an object of the same class as `x`, with the overlaps
information appended. return_* logical params usually allow return of
a lower-level representation of the results instead. Only the
SpatVector,SpatRaster method is different in that it returns a `data.table`

## Details

`feat_subset_column`, `feat_subset_values`, and `feat_count_column`
are specific to overlaps on feature points info, and should not be provided
when overlapping image data. These three params can also be passed to the
`giotto` method through the `...` param when working with overlaps on feature
points info.

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("vizgen")
gpoly <- getPolygonInfo(g,
    polygon_name = "aggregate",
    return_giottoPolygon = TRUE
)
gpoints <- getFeatureInfo(g, return_giottoPoints = TRUE)
gimg <- getGiottoImage(g, image_type = "largeImage")

slot(gpoly, "overlaps") <- NULL
overlaps(gpoly) # Should now be NULL

# detections from 2 z-layers are provided
table(gpoints$global_z)

# calculate all transcripts overlapped
out_all <- calculateOverlap(gpoly, gpoints)
overlaps_all <- overlaps(out_all)
overlaps_all$rna

# calculate z1 only
out_z1 <- calculateOverlap(gpoly, gpoints,
    feat_subset_column = "global_z",
    feat_subset_values = c(1)
)
overlaps_z1 <- overlaps(out_z1)
overlaps_z1$rna

# overlap image to get sum intensities per cell
out_img <- calculateOverlap(gpoly, gimg, progress = FALSE)
overlaps_img <- overlaps(out_img)
overlaps_img$intensity

# giotto method
# calculate z0 overlaps and return as gobject
out_g <- calculateOverlap(g,
    feat_subset_column = "global_z",
    feat_subset_values = 0
)
overlaps(getPolygonInfo(out_g, return_giottoPolygon = TRUE))

# note that z0 and z1 nrows match that from the table of global z values.
# With points overlaps, all points are returned, but non-overlapped points
# only have an `NA` value for the `poly_ID` column. Overlapped points will
# have the `poly_ID` of their overlapping polygon.
