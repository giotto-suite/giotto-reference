# `relate` {#relate}

*Package:* `GiottoClass`  
*Title:* Spatial relationships between geometries
*Aliases:* `relate,giottoSpatial,giottoSpatial-method`, `relate,giotto,giottoSpatial-method`

## Description

`relate()` returns a logical matrix indicating the presence or
absence of a specific spatial relationships between the geometries in
x and y.

## Usage

```r
relate,giottoSpatial,giottoSpatial-method(
  x,
  y,
  relation,
  pairs = TRUE,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  output = c("data.table", "matrix"),
  use_names = TRUE,
  ...
)

relate,giotto,giottoSpatial-method(
  x,
  y,
  ...,
  what = c("polygon", "spatlocs", "points"),
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  spat_locs_name = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `x`: spatial object with records to test
- `y`: spatial object records to test relations against
- `relation`: character. One of "intersects", "touches", "crosses", "overlaps", "within", "contains", "covers", "coveredby", "disjoint", or "equals". It can also be a "DE-9IM" string such as "FF*FF****". See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM) or [GeoTools doc](https://docs.geotools.org/stable/userguide/library/jts/dim9.html)
- `pairs`: logical. If `TRUE` a two-column matrix is returned with the indices of the cases where the requested relation is `TRUE`. This is especially helpful when dealing with many geometries as the returned value is generally much smaller
- `na.rm`: logical. If `TRUE` and `pairs=TRUE`, geometries in `x` for which there is no related geometry in `y` are omitted
- `output`: character. `"data.table"` or `"matrix"`. `"data.table"` is
only possible when `pairs=TRUE`
- `use_names`: logical. If `TRUE`, `pairs=TRUE`, and `output="data.table"`
the IDs of the geometries will be used.
- `...`: additional args to pass
- `what`: character. Which type of spatial data in the `giotto` object to
relate. One of "polygon", "spatlocs", "points"
- `spat_unit`: spatial unit
- `feat_type`: feature type
- `spat_locs_name`: name of spatlocs to use if what = "spatlocs"

## Value

`data.table` if `output="data.table"`. `matrix` if `output="matrix"`

## Examples

```r
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("vizgen")
activeSpatUnit(g) <- "aggregate"
sl <- g[["spatial_locs"]][[1]]
gpoints <- g[["feat_info"]][[1]]
gpoly <- g[["spatial_info"]][[1]]

res1 <- relate(gpoints, gpoly, relation = "intersects")
res2 <- relate(gpoints, gpoly, relation = "intersects", use_names = FALSE)

selection <- system.file("extdata/viz_interactive_select.csv",
    package = "GiottoClass"
)
select_polys <- createGiottoPolygon(
    # we don't want the rownumber column.
    data.table::fread(selection)[, c("x", "y", "name")]
)
res <- relate(g, select_polys, relation = "intersects")
g[, res[y == "polygon1", x]]
g[, res[y == "polygon2", x]]
g[, res[y == "polygon3", x]]
```
